# Learning Center known issues

This section includes a list of known issues with troubleshooting and recovery steps
for Learning Center.

## <a id="training-portal-pending"></a>Training Portal in pending state

Under certain circumstances, the training portal will be stuck in a pending state, the best way to know the issue
is viewing the operator logs. In order to get the logs, you can execute:

```
kubectl logs deployment/learningcenter-operator -n learningcenter
```

Depending on the log, the issue may be:

### <a id="tls-not-available"></a>TLS secret tls is not available

The TLS secret should be on the Learning Center operator namespace, otherwise you will get this error:

```
ERROR:kopf.objects:Handler 'learningcenter' failed temporarily: TLS secret tls is not available
```

#### Solution:
To recover from this issue, you can follow [these steps](../getting-started/learning-center-operator.md#enforce-secure-connect) to create the TLS Secret, once the TLS is created, **you need to redeploy the TrainingPortal resource.**

### <a id="image-policy-webhook-service-not-found"></a>image-policy-webhook-service not found

If you are installing a TAP profile, perhaps you are going to get this error.

```
Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "image-policy-webhook.signing.run.tanzu.vmware.com": failed to call webhook: Post "https://image-policy-webhook-service.image-policy-system.svc:443/signing-policy-check?timeout=10s": service "image-policy-webhook-service" not found
```

#### Solution:
This is a race condition error among some packages, to recover from this error you only need to redeploy the trainingPortal resource.

## <a id="update-parameters"></a>Updating parameters don't work

Normally you will need to update some parameters provided to the Learning Center Operator (E.g. ingressDomain, TLS secret, ingressClass etc), depending the way you used to change the values, you can execute these commands to validate if the parameters were changed:

```
kubectl describe systemprofile
```
or
```
kubectl describe pod  -n learningcenter
```

However, the Training Portals doesn't work or get the updated values.

#### Solution:
By design, the Training Portal resources do not react to any changes on the parameters provided when the training portals were created, because any change on the `trainingportal` resource affects the online user who is running a workshop. To get the new values, you must redeploy the `trainingportal` in a maintenance window where learning center is unavailable while the `systemprofile` gets updated.

## <a id="increase-cluster-resources"></a>Increase your cluster's resources

If you don't have enough nodes or enough resources on nodes for deploying the workloads, node pressure might occur.
In this case, follow your cloud provider's instructions on how to scale out or scale up your cluster.

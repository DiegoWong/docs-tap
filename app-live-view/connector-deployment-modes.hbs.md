# Connector deployment modes in Application Live View

This topic tells you about the different ways in which you can deploy the connector in
Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP).

## <a id='connector-as-deployment'></a> Deploy the connector as a regular deployment

This is the default mode of Application Live View connector in Tanzu Application Platform.
When the connector is running as a regular deployment, it observes all the applications across
all the namespaces in the cluster and registers with the back end.

## <a id='connector-as-daemonset'></a> Deploy the connector as a Kubernetes DaemonSet

When deployed as a Kubernetes DaemonSet the connector discovers applications across all the namespaces
running in a worker node of a Kubernetes cluster.

To run the connector as a DaemonSet:

1. Change the default installation settings for Application Live View connector by running:

   ```console
   tanzu package available get connector.appliveview.tanzu.vmware.com/VERSION-NUMBER --values-schema --namespace tap-install
   ```

   Where `VERSION-NUMBER` is the version of the package listed. For example, `1.9.0`.

   For example:

   ```console
   $ tanzu package available get connector.appliveview.tanzu.vmware.com/1.9.0 --values-schema --namespace tap-install
     KEY                                   DEFAULT             TYPE        DESCRIPTION
     kubernetes_version                                        string      Optional: The Kubernetes Version. Valid values are '1.24.*', or ''.

     backend.sslDeactivated                false               boolean     Flag for whether to disable SSL.
     backend.caCertData                    cert-in-pem-format  string      CA Cert Data for ingress domain.
     backend.host                          <nil>               string      Domain used to reach the Application Live View back end. Prepend
                                                                           "appliveview" subdomain to the value if you use shared ingress. For
                                                                           example: "example.com" becomes "appliveview.example.com".
     backend.ingressEnabled                false               boolean     Flag for the connector to connect to ingress on back end.

     backend.port                          <nil>               number      Port to reach the Application Live View back end.
     connector.deployment.enabled          true                boolean      Flag for the connector to run in deployment mode
     connector.deployment.replicas           1                 number      Number of replicas of connector pods at any given time
     connector.namespace_scoped.enabled    false               boolean     Flag for the connector to run in namespace scope.
     connector.namespace_scoped.namespace  default             string      Namespace to deploy connector.
     kubernetes_distribution                                   string      Kubernetes distribution that this package is being installed on. Accepted
                                                                           values: ['''',''openshift''].
     activateAppLiveViewSecureAccessControl                    boolean     Optional: Configuration required to enable Secure Access Connection between App Live View components.
     activateSensitiveOperations                               boolean     Optional: Configuration to allow connector to execute sensitive operations on a running application.
   ```

   For more information about values schema options, see the properties listed earlier.

2. Override the deployment mode for the connector by using the following configuration values for the
   `app-live-view-connector-values.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    appliveview_connector:
      connector:
        deployment:
          enabled: false
          replicas: 1
    ```

   By default, `connector.deployment.enabled` is set to `true`.

   The `connector.deployment.replicas` key specifies the number of replicas of connector pods
   running at any given time.

## <a id='connector-as-nmspc-scpd'></a> Deploy the connector in namespace-scoped mode

When the connector is deployed in namespace-scoped mode, it discovers applications within the
namespace of a Kubernetes cluster.

To deploy the connector in namespace-scoped mode, use the following configuration values for the
connector in `app-live-view-connector-values.yaml`:

```yaml
appliveview_connector:
  connector:
    namespace_scoped:
      enabled: true
      namespace: "NAMESPACE"
```

Where `NAMESPACE` specifies the namespace for deploying the connector

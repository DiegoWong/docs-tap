# Scan samples for Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

> **Note** This topic is part of Scan 1.0. Scan 1.0 has been deprecated as of the TAP 1.9 release.  Scan 1.0 will remain the default in the [test and scan supply chain](../../getting-started/add-test-and-security.hbs.md#add-testing-and-scanning-to-your-application) in the TAP 1.9 release but it is recommended to opt-in to Scan 2.0 as Scan 1.0 will be replaced as the default and removed in a future version.  For more information about Scan 1.0 versus Scan 2.0, see the [scan overview page](./overview.hbs.md)
